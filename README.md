# Skymood Relay

A real-time Bluesky [emoji tracker](https://skymood.skorfmann.com/) built with Bun. This service connects to Bluesky's firehose and monitors posts for emoji usage, allowing clients to subscribe to specific emoji patterns and receive notifications in real-time. [Read more about it](https://dev.to/skorfmann/skymood-watch-blueskys-heartbeat-through-emojis-in-real-time-4knm) and reach out on Bluesky [@skorfmann](https://bsky.app/profile/skorfmann.com).

## Goal

Skymood Relay aims to reduce client-side network traffic by an order of magnitude compared to connecting directly to Bluesky's [Jetstream](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream). While Jetstream provides a full firehose of Bluesky activities, Skymood Relay focuses specifically on emoji usage patterns, allowing clients to receive only the emoji-related data they're interested in. This targeted approach significantly reduces bandwidth requirements while still enabling real-time emoji tracking and analysis.

This can be easily adapted to similar scenarios where you need to filter and relay specific patterns from a larger data stream.
